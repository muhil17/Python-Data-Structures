# Python-Data-Structures

Python has four basic inbuilt data structures. They are 
1) List
2) Tuple
3) Set
4) Dictionary


These almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures. These built-in data structures come with default methods and behind the scenes optimizations that make them easy to use. Most data structures in Python are modified forms of these or use the built-in structures as their backbone.

In this repository you will understand the 4 data structures in simple terms with examples.
